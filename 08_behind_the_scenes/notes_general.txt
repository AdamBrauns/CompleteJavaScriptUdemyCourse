In high-level programming, you do not have to worry about resources, with the downside of not being as optimized as low level code.

Garbage-collection: algorithm in javascript engine that removed old, unused objects.

Interpreted or just-in-time compiled: abstraction over 0's and 1's

Multi-paradigm: Approach and overall mindset of programming. Examples:
  - Procedural programming
  - Object-oriented programming (OOP)
  - Functional programming (FP)
javascript is flexible and can do all three

First-class functions: functions are simply treated as variables. You can pass them into other functions and return them from functions

Dynamically typed: Can assign variables to different data types dynamically (alterative is strongly typed)

concurrency model: how the javascript engine handles multiple tasks.
  - javascript runs in one single thread, so it can only do one thing at a time
  - Event loop takes long running tasks, executes them in the 'background' and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished
